# YooBee Web & UX 2019: Assignment 3

Hello! We are four students each working on an individual web application to run as part of this group project. 

Jeremy and Jack are creating interfaces to showcase Behance designer portfolios; Geoff and Holly are creating place-finder apps for a particular destination.

This assignment constitutes part of our course at [YooBee School of Design](https://www.yoobee.ac.nz/); as such it is purely for educational purposes, but if you are interested then by all means [get involved](https://github.com/sargimo/Assignment-3-take-2/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md)!

## Tech
The project uses the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) framework and APIs specific to each group member's use case. 
We use [vue-resource](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-resource) for requests and responses and [vue-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-router) to handle page routing.
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is used to handle some styling and interactions.
If you are planning to contribute, please follow best practices and the conventions outlined in the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/sargimo/Assignment-3-take-2/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md).
